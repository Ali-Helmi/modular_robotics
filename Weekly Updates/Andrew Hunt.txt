1. I created a python program that will serve as the overall controller for the robot, which splits off two more processes to deal with object detection and navigation. I also programmed my firmware into the latest motor driver design and confirmed that it is able to control the motor's speed and direction correctly.

2. I continued working on the overall controller program, which mostly involved working on the terminal user interface. I built a test device for testing my motor control program while waiting for the physical modules to be finished, this will be used for testing with the object detection code. I also tweaked the UART communication code for the MCUs to give better information when errors occur.
