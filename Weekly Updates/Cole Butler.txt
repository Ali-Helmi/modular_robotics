Week Jan 30:
	- completed design for gripper arm pcb and got started on ordering (contacted business office on Wednesday, 2/1)
	- had new housing connecting faces printed

Week Feb 6:
	- didn't hear back from ECEN business office until Monday (2/6) and they needed some additional info to place the order for the pcbs
	- Tuesday (2/7), business office told me that their email system messed up so I had to resend stuff for order to be placed. Should be good now.
	- tested printed housing connecting faces, and they connect easily and stay together.
		- it could be a little better as the connecting parts dont seeme very durable and get worn down quickly, but it should be an easy fix.
		
Update since Week Feb 6:
	- arm and sensor PCBs assembled
	- new working housing connecting design added to all housings
		- this was tedious and time consuming due to issues in the original way I made the housing in SOLIDWORKS. So I decieded to remake
		  all the housing now that I'm comfortable with SOLIDWORKS so that any changes will be easier to make.
	- connector PCBs ordered and expected March 2, plan to asseble them during the Blitz
	- updated gripper/arm housing for new arm dimensions
	- modified wheel module to have motor seated lower (this is to ensure good clearance below the robot when the wheels are on)
